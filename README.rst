The `dd` crate provides the classes, enums and traits that I found useful to
create a Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition games. I did not create such a game,
I'm merely coding the necessary tools to do it.

Please note that this is a **work in progress and it shouldn't be used** in its
current form. Why?

- I played table D&D more than 20 years ago. I don't even know how it works
  anymore. I had to read everything from scratch to understand how the 5th
  edition works. I did spent countless hours playing BG2 though. My point is
  I'm not the best person to code this lib!
- There's a lot more work left to do than what's currently done. For example,
  there's no handling of race (only an enum for now), languages, features,
  spells, cantrips, etc.

My goals with this project are:

- Learn Rust by using it in a complex domain.
- Respect all the damn D&D 5th rules
- Test it a lot, because I want the previous point to be true
- Random character creation
- Make this lib so nice that it could be used in a real game, like Baldur's
  Gate, Icewind Date, Planescape Torment, etc. I'm not a game designer myself
  so I'll be very happy if someone creates a game out of it!
